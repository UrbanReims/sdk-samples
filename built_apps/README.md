## App Descriptions ##

- **5GSpeed**
    - Run Ookla speedtests via NCM API.  Results are put in asset_id field (configurable in SDK Data).  Clearing the results starts a new test.  This can be done easily via NCM API v2 /routers/ endpoint.
- **Autoinstall**
    - Automatically choose fastest SIM on install.  On bootup, AutoInstall detects SIMs, and ensures (clones) they have unique WAN profiles for prioritization. Then the app collects diagnostics and runs Ookla speedtests on each SIM. Then the app prioritizes the SIMs WAN Profiles by TCP download speed.  Results are written to the log, set as the description field, and sent as a custom alert. The app can be manually triggered again by clearing out the description field in NCM.  
- **Boot2**
    - On bootup, this application will perform a speedtest on each SIM and prioritize them based on TCP download.  Results are logged, sent as an alert, and PUT to NCM API "custom1" field.
- **Installer_UI**
    - Provide a web interface for installers to configure WiFi and run speedtests.
- **Mobile_Site_Survey**
    - Robust Site Survey app with cloud aggregating and reporting via 5g-ready.io
- **cp_shell_**
    - Web interface for running linux shell commands.
- **cpu_usage**
    - Gets cpu and memory usage information from the router every 30 seconds and writes a csv file to a usb stick formatted in fat32.
- **ftp_client**
    - Creates a file and uploads it to an FTP server.
- **ftp_server**
    - Creates an FTP server in the device. A USB memory device is used as the FTP directory.
- **geofences**
    - Send alert when entering or exiting geofences.  Configure geofences in SDK app data after loading app.
- **gpio_any_wan_connected**
    - Set GPIO out high when any wan (not just modems) is connected.
- **gps_probe**
    - Probe the GPS hardware and log the results.
- **hello_world**
    - Outputs a 'Hello World!' log every 10 seconds.
- **hspt**
    - Sets up a custom Hot Spot landing page.
- **ibr1700_gnss**
    - Demonstrates how to access the gyroscope and accelerometer data on the IBR1700
- **ibr1700_obdII**
    - Demonstrates how to access OBD-II PIDs on the IBR1700
- **logfile**
    - Writes router logs to flash available for download via HTTP/NCM LAN Manager port 8000.
- **mosquitto**
    - Demonstrates launching embedded mosquitto server
- **mqtt_app**
    - Demonstrated MQTT using the paho library
- **mqtt_azure_client**
    - Sample Application which uses SDK to send sensor data to Microsoft Azure IoT Central.
- **mqtt_azure_tls**
    - Sample Application which uses SDK to send sensor data to Microsoft Azure IoT Central over TLS connection.
- **OBDII_monitor**
    - Monitor OBD-II values, put latest values in asset_id, and alert on conditions defined in SDK AppData.
- **ping_sample**
    - Contains ping function and example usage.
- **ports_status**
    - Sets the device description to visually show the LAN/WAN/WWAN/Modem/IP Verify status
- **python_module_list**
    - This app will log the python version and modules in the device. It is intended to help with app development to show the python environment within the device.
- **send_to_server**
    - Gets the '/status' from the device config store and send it to a test server.
- **simple_custom_dashboard**
    - Creates a simple dashboard using HTML and JS. Note that any 'server function' requires the router firewall to be correctly changed to allow client access to the router.
- **simple_web_server**
    - A simple web server to receive messages. Note that any 'server function' requires the router firewall to be correctly changed to allow client access to the router.
- **system_monitor**
    - Get various system diagnostics, alert on thresholds, and put current status in asset_id field.
- **tornado_sample**
	- A webserver using Tornado with NCM-themed example to set WiFi SSIDs.
