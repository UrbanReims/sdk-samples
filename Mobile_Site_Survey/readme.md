Application Name
================
Mobile Site Survey


Application Version
===================
2.5


External Requirements
=====================
- Modem(s) with cellular connectivity
- GPS antenna and location lock


Application Purpose
===================
This app is intended to perform drive testing of cellular networks but also works for testing stationary deployments.
It will run automatic tests collecting location (GPS), interface diagnostics (including cellular signal), and speedtests (optional).

The app is configurable through a webUI running on port 8000.  Use NCM Remote Connect to 127.0.0.1 port 8000 HTTP.
Or locally, forward the Primary LAN Zone to the Router Zone with the Default Allow All policy.

* Execute Manual Survey - a button is provided at the top to start testing. Or delete the description field.
* Download Results - Opens a new tab with results files (CSV) available for download.
* Save Config - saves Mobile Site Survey configuration to router.

Survey Options:

* Run Distance based tests - The app will run tests when the router has moved the distance defined
* Distance Between Tests (meters) - Set the distance for automatic testing

* Run Time based tests - The app will run tests at the time interval defined
* Time Between Tests (seconds) - Set the time interval for automatic testing

Both distance and timed tests can be enabled.
Note: New tests cannot start until all current interface tests complete.

* Test Ethernet and Wifi-as-WAN - Disabled only tests cellular modems
* Run Speedtests - Include Ookla TCP upload and download tests (if disabled, app will ping 8.8.8.8 to measure latency)
* Monitor Packet Loss Between Tests - Continuously ping 8.8.8.8 and track tx/rx, packet loss
* Write to .csv - Write test results to .csv file on router flash (Accessible via FTP server)
* Debug Logs - Additional debugging logs for application troubleshooting.

Send to Server
Powered by https://5g-ready.io
* Enable Send to Server - Application will send results to server using HTTP POST
* Include Full Interface Diagnostics - send all available diagnostics (not just signal)
* Include Application Logs - send testing logs (useful for troubleshooting)
* Server URL - The URL of the HTTP server to send the results to (e.g. https://5g-ready.io/injector)
* Server Token - Bearer token for server authentication

Surveyors
If you have multiple routers that you would like to synchronize testing with the app will start them at the same time.
Be sure routers are reachable on port 8000.
* Enable Surveyors - Trigger remote routers applications to test at the same time
* Surveyors - Enter the IP Addresses of other routers, separated by commas.

---

By default the app will tests every 50 meters including speedtests and write results to a .csv file.

You can edit the default settings in settings.py
